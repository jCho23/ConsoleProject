using System;

//For Loops
//Have 3 parts: 
//Initization Clause: How many times the loop goes 
//Condition Clause: Loop will keep going as long as condition is still valid
//Iteration Clause: Increment or Decrement the Counter 

//Foreach Loops
//Used to iterate Enumerable Objects: Anything that has a list or an Array nature
//i.e.
//foreach (var number in numbers)
//"number" is local or temporary variable and "numbers" is the list
//notice the "in" keyword

//While Loops
//similar to ForLoop but different syntax

//Do-While Loops
//Condition is evaulated at the end of the loop
//You don't need a counter
